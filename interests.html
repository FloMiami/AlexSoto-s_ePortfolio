    <h2>Software Engineering </h2>
    <p>
      One of my passions is software engineering. I love solving difficult problems and admire the work that innovative auto manufacturers Tesla and Mercedez-Benz are doing with the software in their newer vehicles. I utilize LinkedIn to network and learn from other Software Engineering professionals and strongly advise anyone interested in S.W.E to be on LinkedIn. I have found many great software engineering newsletters on LinkedIn that teach me something new every day.

    <h2>Stock Market Investing </h2>
    <p>
     Another one of my passions is stock market investing. I have been an active investor since the age of 18. I have had great gains in the thousands as well as horrible losses in the thousands. My two favorite mentors in investing are Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger. I have read the autobiography of Warren Buffet and recommend it to anyone trying to learn about stock market investments. It is easy to read and very interesting. I find their advice refreshing and practical in a world where social media “gurus” try to convince everyone that buying their course on trading options will make them a millionaire.
