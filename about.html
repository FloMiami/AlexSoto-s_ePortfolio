    <h2>Growing Up</h2>
    <p>
     I was born in November of 2002 to Mexican immigrant parents in  the Chicagoland area of Illinois. My parents worked hard everyday to put a roof over me and my two sister's head's. My parents always preached to me about the value of an education and pushed me to do well in school. I will forever be grateful to them for instilling in me values of hard work as well as Catholism. In elementry school the teachers noticed that I excelled at math and science, and oftentimes I would sit outside and work on the asssingments by myself because I was so far ahead compared to my classmates. This isolation made me lonely so I picked up baseball and basketball and I made a lot of my friends through sports which I still play to this day.

  <h2> Learning To Love Technlogy </h2>
   <p> I always had a thing for tech. I learned to play video games at the same time I learned to speak and walk. I grew up playing my sisters Nintendo 64, eventually getting a Gameboy and Nintendo D.S. By the time I was nine I was using my sister's samsung tablet to illegally download Minecraft for free by jailbreaking the device. I always had a creative mind. So in 5th grade I applied for the Magnet Academy in my city which was a 2nd-8th grade school for math and science and was accepted. They gave every student personal laptop's to take home and complete homework with. When I was in 5th grade I was introduced to programming via Code.Org and fell in love. I used to work on creating video games and loved the challenge of getting it all to work. In 7th and 8th I took robotics classes where we would program these lego robots to complete obstabcle courses and again, I fell in love with it. Working on a problem untill I got the robot to work right was just so satisfying to me. This love for problem solving using technology and robotics is what lead me to where I am today.

    <h2> College and Beyond </h2>
    
    <p>
    During my senior year of college I decided I would pursue my higher education at Dominican University in River Forest,IL. To me it just felt like the right thing to do. It was a religous private school located in a city secluded by nature and only 15 minutes away from Downtown Chicago. By this point I was already interested in investing so I could not decide between majoring in either Comp Sci and Business Administration. After sitting down with a consouler at Dominican and explaining my situation, he recommended me to major in Informatics. Informatics is essentially the crossroads of Comp Sci, Business, Information Systems, and Data Science. I decided to go with it and haven't looked back since. I truly am grateful for the support of my Informatics advisors Don Hamerly and Hassan Zamir. My adviors have supported me greatly along the way . In the summer of 2023 I helped my advisor Hassan Zamir, who is the director of the Informatics program at Dominican Universiy with a research project. As a research assistant I used reference managment software to analyze peer-reviewed papers and come up with conclusions on the use-cases, benefits, and downfalls of Artificial Intellgience systems in the education sector. I have also been a active member of the Technlogy, Engineering, and Mathmatics club. I am proud to say that my accompliments led me to my next venture, a 2024 summer intership at CDW in the downtown Chicago location. CDW is one of the countries top I.T solutions company. I am excited to see what the future holds.
